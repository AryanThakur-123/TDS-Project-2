| Log GDP per capita                | 9.40   | 1.15    | 5.53   | 8.51   | 9.50   | 10.39  | 11.68  |
| Social support                    | 0.81   | 0.12    | 0.23   | 0.74   | 0.83   | 0.90   | 0.99   |
| Healthy life expectancy at birth   | 63.4   | 6.84    | 6.72   | 59.20  | 65.10  | 68.55  | 74.60  |
| Freedom to make life choices      | 0.75   | 0.14    | 0.23   | 0.66   | 0.77   | 0.86   | 0.99   |
| Generosity                        | 0.0001 | 0.16    | -0.34  | -0.11  | -0.02  | 0.09   | 0.70   |
| Perceptions of corruption          | 0.74   | 0.18    | 0.04   | 0.69   | 0.80   | 0.87   | 0.98   |
| Positive affect                   | 0.65   | 0.11    | 0.18   | 0.57   | 0.66   | 0.74   | 0.88   |
| Negative affect                   | 0.27   | 0.09    | 0.08   | 0.21   | 0.26   | 0.33   | 0.71   |

### Missing Values

The dataset also reveals that there are several missing values across multiple features, notably:
- **Log GDP per capita**: 28 missing entries
- **Social support**: 13 missing entries
- **Healthy life expectancy at birth**: 63 missing entries
- **Freedom to make life choices**: 36 missing entries
- **Generosity**: 81 missing entries
- **Perceptions of corruption**: 125 missing entries
- **Positive affect**: 24 missing entries
- **Negative affect**: 16 missing entries

These missing values may affect the robustness of our analysis and should be addressed in further modeling efforts.

## Correlation Insights

A correlation matrix indicates relationships between various measures. Below are the notable correlations:

- **Life Ladder & Log GDP per capita**: Strong positive correlation (0.78) indicates that higher GDP is associated with higher perceived happiness.
- **Life Ladder & Social Support**: Strong positive correlation (0.72) suggests a significant relationship between social connections and well-being.
- **Life Ladder & Healthy Life Expectancy at Birth**: Another strong positive correlation (0.71) suggests a link between health and happiness.
- **Life Ladder & Perceptions of Corruption**: A negative correlation (-0.43) indicates that higher perceived corruption negatively impacts happiness.
- **Negative Affect & Freedom to Make Life Choices**: A negative correlation (-0.28) indicates that limited freedom correlates with higher negative emotions.

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals substantial insights into the factors influencing global well-being. Notably, economic stability (as measured by GDP), social support, and overall health significantly correlate with happiness levels. Future analyses should focus on addressing missing data to enhance further interpretative power and derive deeper insights across temporal changes in these indicators.
